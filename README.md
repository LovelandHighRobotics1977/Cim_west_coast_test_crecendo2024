basic test robot for the 2024 FRC game. drive motors must be can ID 2&3 for the right side as the robot would be driving away, and 4&5 for the left side. the mech motors are ID 16&15.
this is written to be used for cim motors in a west coast configuration. using phenix V5 because our firmware wont update properly. 
uses the Saitek X45 joysticks. the main stick is for single stick tank drive and the throttle controlls speed. the buttons for the index finger are for the mech. right to shoot and left for intake.
the auto just turns on the shooter.
