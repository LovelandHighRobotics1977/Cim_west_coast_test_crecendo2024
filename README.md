basic test robot for the 2024 FRC game. drive motors must be can ID 2&3 for the right side as the robot would be driving away, and 4&5 for the left side. the mech motors are ID 16&15.
this is written to be used for cim motors in a west coast configuration. using phenix V5 because our firmware wont update properly. 

If you use the Saitek X45 joysticks. the main stick is for single stick tank drive and the throttle controlls speed. the buttons for the index finger are for the mech. Up to shoot and left for intake, right shoots at a lower speed for the amp. These speeds can be ajusted using the upper knob on the throttle.

there is also code for an xbox controller that uses dual stick tank drive from the two sticks of the controller. the mech is run by the A, X, and Y buttons.
A controlls the intake, X shoots for the amp at a lower speed, and Y shoots higer. The B button on the controller toggles the drive speed for the robot.

There is no auto.
